  <p> My fascination with technology reignites whenever I click on a new website, application or software program. The passion of computer scientists and engineers have led to the development of things we only dreamed possible. The things we see on a regular basis in our modern world were imagined years ago and that gives me assurance that technology affords an innovative platform and that we still have a lot to discover and accomplish in this broad field.

    For about a year now, I have become familiar with coding, I coded my first website with HTML using the <abbr title="Visual Studio Code"> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">V.S.C</a></abbr> platform.
        My major coding experiences came from learning on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/?g_network=g&g_productchannel=&g_adid=528849219280&g_locinterest=&g_keyword=codecademy&g_acctid=243-039-7011&g_adtype=&g_keywordid=aud-1122464209402:kwd-41065460761&g_ifcreative=&g_campaign=account&g_locphysical=1010294&g_adgroupid=70492864474&g_productid=&g_source={sourceid}&g_merchantid=&g_placement=&g_partition=&g_campaignid=1726903838&g_ifproduct=&utm_id=t_aud-1122464209402:kwd-41065460761:ag_70492864474:cp_1726903838:n_g:d_c&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_term=codecademy&utm_campaign=INTL_Brand_Exact&utm_content=528849219280&g_adtype=search&g_acctid=243-039-7011&gclid=CjwKCAiArNOeBhAHEiwAze_nKLOssrztvf0Pbfv6VnmG8RqvXoH5wa6Y7DNtSsvv6lP3WYRF7GA5cRoCn7EQAvD_BwE">codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org?">freecodecamp.</a> I also took a one year course with 
        <abbr title="European Computer Driving License."><a href="https://icdleurope.org/">ECDL
        </a></abbr>_an internationally recognised certificate in 2020 where I learned a lot of things including word processing, improving productivity using IT, online essentials, spreadsheet and presentation software.

    Character and other Skills
 </h3>
 <section id="Character">
<p>
         I am also very creative, organized, calm in stressful environments, a good problem solver and my melancholic temperament makes me self-reliant, thoughtful and very detail-oriented. Although mathematics seems ubiquitous, I enjoy learning new mathematics topics especially in algebra and finding different approches to solve problems. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to meet and listen to different people from diverse spheres of life and I have discovered that in order to attain a high level of success, it is incumbent that one not only has the qualities of honesty, hard work and determination but one must also have clear goals which are in line with one's vision.

<h3>
    Role Model
</h3>
<section id="#Role Model">
<p>
  "In my life, I have benefited from not taking the conventional wisdom. It's benefited me personally, and I think it has benefited the business."_Tope Awotona. This quote gives me a steady reminder and cautions me whenever I am about taking important decisions that doing what everyone else does and always taking the easy way in life might just make one fade into the crowd and never get the chance to deploy his/her potentials maximally.
