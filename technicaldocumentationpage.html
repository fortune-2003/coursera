    <p>
        Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces in their color, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh century India. The rules of chess as they are known today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.

Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.

<p>
    At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so that each player has the white (or light) color square in the bottom right-hand side.
    The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square.

    <header class="header" id="How_the_chess_pieces_move">How the chess pieces move</header>
<p>Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="King">
<header id="King" class="header">King</header>
<p>
    The king is the most important piece, but is one of the weakest. The king can only move one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally.
    The king may never move himself into check (where he could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check".
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Queen">
<header id="Queen" class="header">Queen</header>
<p>
    The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces. 
    And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over. Notice how the white queen captures the black queen and then the black king is forced to move.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Rook">
<header id="Rook" class="header">Rook</header>
<p>
    A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Bishop">
<header id="Bishop" class="header">Bishop</header>
<p>
    The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color.
    Bishops work well together because they cover up each other's weaknesses.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Knight">
<header id="Knight" class="header">Knight</header>
<p>
    A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Pawn">
<header id="Pawn" class="header">Pawn</header>
<p>
    Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward but capture diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.
    Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They can never move or capture backward. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.
</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Castling">
<header class="header" id="Castling">Castling</header>
<p>
    Castling is the only move that allows two pieces to move during the same turn.

During castling a king moves two spaces towards the rook that it will castle with, and the rook jumps to the other side. The king can castle to either side as long as: <br>
<ol>
    <li> The king has not moved.</li>
    <li>The king is not in check.</li>
    <li>The king does not move through or into check.</li>
    <li>There are no pieces between the king and castling-side rook.</li>
    <li>The castling-side rook has not moved.</li>
</ol>
    <p>It does not matter if:
    </p> 
    <ol>
        <li> If the king was in check, but is no longer.</li>
        <li> If the rook can be attacked by an opponent's piece before castling. </li>
    </ol>
</p>
</section>
 <section class="main-section" id="En_Passant">
<header class="header" id="En_Passant">En Passant</header>
<p>En passant is a special movement for pawns attacking pawns. It only applies if your opponent moves a pawn two spaces, and its destination space is next to your pawn. You can take the opposing piece by moving forward-diagonal to your pawn's attacked square.</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="check">
    <header class="header" id="check">check</header>
    <p>A king is in check when an opponent's piece is in a position that can attack the king. A player must move their king out of check, block the check or capture the attacking piece.
        A player cannot move their king into check.</p>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="checkmate">
<header class="header" id="checkmate">checkmate</header>
<p>A checkmate in chess is a game-ending state in which one player's king is threatened, and the player cannot move their king out of danger or take the threatening piece. When a player successfully puts their opponent in checkmate, they win the game.</p>
</section>
<section id="stalemate" class="main-section">
    <header class="header" id="stalemate">stalemate</header>
    <p>
        A stalemate is a special type of draw in the game of chess that occurs when the chess player who has to move cannot make any legal moves to a safe square but is also not in check. Stalemate typically ends the game with a draw—a scenario in which there is no way for either player to win the game.
